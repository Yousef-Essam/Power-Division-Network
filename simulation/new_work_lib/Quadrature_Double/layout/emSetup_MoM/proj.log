Momentum MomEngine_64 9.0.103 (*) 370.600 Mar  9 2011
Simulation started on: Sat May 13 19:01:29 2023
Simulation Mode: RF
Substrate valid
Automatically determined a snap distance of
0.0021 mil for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.001 mil.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.

...initializing

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout is electrically large above 3.14 GHz (space wave radiation)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Substrate is electrically large above 4.67 GHz (surface wave radiation)
RF simulation can be less accurate as it ignores radiation
Consider:  - lowering the maximum frequency
           - simulating in MW mode
