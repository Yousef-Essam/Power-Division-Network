# Power-Division-Network-Design
The objective of the project was to create a microwave network that could distribute power evenly between two loads, while considering the isolation between the outputs and their orthogonal relationship.
The project involved the generation of various designs using microstrip and lumped components. 
The [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jxzZkuGFPxoDkinP80kKd3EmWzpcqv3J/view) presents a comparison of the different responses exhibited by these designs, showcasing their characteristics and performance.
## Power-Division-Network-Manufacturing
The project aimed to create a design that could be effectively manufactured, ensuring a seamless transition from the design phase to the manufacturing stage.
So one of the designs was selected for production, and its results were then compared to the simulation outcomes in this [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s222ZiIp5RGhS4IHlHfk_1quhVAY7pju/view).
